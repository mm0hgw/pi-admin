# We use 'getent' to pull the host IP/ethernet address from the environment. 
# The hostname is pointed to an address in the 127.0.0.0 block by default. 
# Very Bad Things can happen if the hostname is not resolvable to an IP 
# address, however, this isn't an issue if we always run the n2n edge daemon.
# It does mean that the IP/ethernet addresses are not set here but by the nss 
# system, as available at boot time which probably means /etc/hosts and 
# /etc/ethers depending upon your setup
